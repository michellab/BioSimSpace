  description: |
                BioSimSpace is an interoperable Python framework for
                biomolecular simulation. With it you can:

                * Write robust and portable biomolecular workflow components
                  that work on different hardware, with different software
                  packages, and that can be run in different ways, e.g.
                  command-line, Jupyter.
                * Interact with molecular-simulation processes in real time.

                To install:

                `conda install -c conda-forge -c michellab biosimspace`

                To install the development version:

                `conda install -c conda-forge -c michellab/label/dev biosimspace`

                When updating the development version it is generally advised to
                update Sire at the same time:

                `conda install -c conda-forge -c michellab/label/dev biosimspace sire`

                Since BioSimSpace has many dependencies, an install or update
                might not always give you the most recent version. If this is
                the case, use, e.g.:

                `conda install -c conda-forge -c michellab/label/dev biosimspace --all`
