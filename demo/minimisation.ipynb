In this case you'll need to upload files for any of the `File` or `FileSet` input requirements. The GUI below will provide buttons that allow you to browse your own filesystem and select files. Since Jupyter has a limit of 5MB for file transfers, we provide support for compressed formats, such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. (A single archive can contain a set of files, allowing you to set a single value for a `FileSet` requirement.) We've provided some example input files that can be used in the training notebooks, which are available to download from the links below. These can then be re-uploaded using the GUI.\n",
