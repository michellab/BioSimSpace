This will allow us to document the inputs, define their type, and specify any constraints on their allowed values. Here we will need a set of files that define the molecular system, and a string that will specify the format to convert to. Note that the string can only be one of a set of allowed values. We directly query the `BSS.IO` package to generate the dropdown of allowed options. (If you don't know what these formats are, then run, e.g. `BSS.IO.formatInfo(\"GroTop\")` for a description.)"

Since Jupyter has a limit of 5MB for file transfers, we provide support for compressed formats, such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. (A single archive can contain a set of files, allowing you to set a single value for a `FileSet` requirement.) We've provided some example input files that can be used in the training notebooks, which are available to download from the links below. These can then be re-uploaded using the GUI.\n",
