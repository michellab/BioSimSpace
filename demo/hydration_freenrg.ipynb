    "In this notebook you'll learn how to use BioSimSpace to set up a set of _alchemical_ free energy simulations to compute the relative free energy of hydration ethane and methanol. Alchemical free energy calculations employ unphysical (\"alchemical\") intermediates to estimate the free energies of various physical processes. Here, we will exploit a perturbation pathway between ethane and methanol which will allow us to estimate the relative free energy difference in solution, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sol}}$, and vacuum, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vac}}$. The free energy of hydration, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$, can then be computed from the difference between the free energy of the solvation and vacuum simulation legs, i.e.\n",

Choosing a sensible number of windows is extremely important for achieving a stable perturbation and good sampling.
