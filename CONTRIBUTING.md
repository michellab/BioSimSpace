We welcome all helpful contributions to improving the quality of BioSimSpace. We have a

Ways you can help include:

* Writing new tutorials, short how-to guides or blog posts.
* Creating more tests and adding them to the pytest library.
* Porting and testing BioSimSpace on different computers.
* Proposing and helping write or test new features.
* Funding development by donating to OpenBioSim.
* We accept pull requests to the devel branch and are happy to discuss ideas via GitHub issues on the repo.
