BioSimSpace.Convert
===================

The *Convert* package contains tools for converting between different molecular
representations. Due to the different way that molecules are represented, full
round trip conversion isn't yet possible. For example, starting with a BioSimSpace
system object, you perform multiple conversions and end up back with a list of
BioSimSpace molecules, i.e. those in the original system. Where possible, we try
to return converted objects as the smallest possible object, i.e. a single residue
molecule will be returned as a residue, a single atom residue will be returned as
an atom. As always, you can use the native functionality of the returned object
to convert to a different object if desired.
