===============

The *Box* package contains tools for generating parameters for different
simulation boxes. This is particularly useful when needing box magnitudes and
angles for generating :ref:`ref-Solvent` boxes.

To support triclinic boxes that work across the range of molecular simulation
engines that support, we represent the triclinic space in reduced form, using
the approach documented in Appendix A of Chapter 3 from
`"Molecular dynamics of sense and sensibility in processing and analysis of data" <https://research.rug.nl/files/2839528/01_c1.pdf>`__
by Tsjerk A. Wassenaar.
