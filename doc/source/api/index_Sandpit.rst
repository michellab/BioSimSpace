BioSimSpace.Sandpit
===================

The *Sandpit* enables support for experimental functionality alongside the
development build of BioSimSpace. To use a particular sandpit, e.g. ``X``

.. code-block:: python

   import BioSimSpace.Sandpit.X as BSS

Sandpits allow us to quickly roll out experimental features while we work
on ways to merge them into the main code in an interoperable way.
