BioSimSpace.Process
===================

The *Process* package contains tools for running different simulation protocols
with a range of external molecular dynamics packages. Process objects are
instantiated with a molecular :class:`System <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.System>`
and a :class:`Protocol <BioSimSpace.Protocol>`, i.e. they are used to apply
a protocol to a system of molecules.

Process objects can be automatically generated by the
:class:`BioSimSpace.MD.run <BioSimSpace.MD.run>` function, which will choose
the most appropriate molecular dynamics driver based on the software available
on the host, the available hardware, the molecular system, and protocol.

At a minimum, derived Process classes should override the base class
``start``, ``getSystem``, and ``getTrajectory`` methods to start the process,
and to get the latest molecular system or trajectory from the running process.

Processes write input and output to a working directory, which can be
specified using the ``work_dir`` keyword argument. If nothing is specifed,
then a temporary working directory will be used, which is bound to the lifetime
of the process.
