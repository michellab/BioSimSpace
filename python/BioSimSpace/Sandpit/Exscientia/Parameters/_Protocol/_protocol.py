        Parameters
        ----------

        forcefield : str
            The name of the force field.

        ensure_compatible : bool
            Whether to ensure that the topology of the parameterised molecule is
            compatible with that of the original molecule. An exception will be
            raised if this isn't the case, e.g. if atoms have been added. Set
            this to False is parameterising lone oxygen atoms corresponding to
            structural (crystal) water molecules.

        property_map : dict
            A dictionary that maps system "properties" to their user defined
            values. This allows the user to refer to properties with their
            own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }
