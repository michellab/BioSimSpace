           Parameters
           ----------

           system : :class:`System <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.System>`
               The molecular system for the perturbation leg. This must contain
               a single perturbable molecule and is assumed to have already
               been equilibrated.

           protocol : :class:`Protocol.FreeEnergy <BioSimSpace.Protocol.FreeEnergy>`, \
               The simulation protocol.

           work_dir : str
               The working directory for the free-energy perturbation
               simulation.

           engine: str
               The molecular dynamics engine used to run the simulation. Available
               options are "AMBER", "GROMACS", or "SOMD". If this argument is omitted
               then BioSimSpace will choose an appropriate engine for you.

           gpu_support : bool
               Whether the engine must have GPU support.

           setup_only: bool
               Whether to only support simulation setup. If True, then no
               simulation processes objects will be created, only the directory
               hierarchy and input files to run a simulation externally. This
               can be useful when you don't intend to use BioSimSpace to run
               the simulation. Note that a 'work_dir' must also be specified.

           ignore_warnings : bool
               Whether to ignore warnings when generating the binary run file.
               This option is specific to GROMACS and will be ignored when a
               different molecular dynamics engine is chosen.

           show_errors : bool
               Whether to show warning/error messages when generating the binary
               run file. This option is specific to GROMACS and will be ignored
               when a different molecular dynamics engine is chosen.

           extra_options : dict
               A dictionary containing extra options. Overrides the ones generated from the protocol.

           extra_lines : list
               A list of extra lines to be put at the end of the script.
           
           estimator : str

           method : str
               The method to be used for analysis ('alchemlyb' or 'native').
               Alchemlyb refers to using the alchemlyb library, whilst
               native refers to the analysis implemented within the engine itself.
               Estimator used for the analysis - must be either 'MBAR' or 'TI'.

           restraint : :class:`Restraint <BioSimSpace.FreeEnergy.Restraint>`
               The Restraint object that contains information for the ABFE
               calculations.

           property_map : dict
               A dictionary that maps system "properties" to their user defined
               values. This allows the user to refer to properties with their
               own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }
