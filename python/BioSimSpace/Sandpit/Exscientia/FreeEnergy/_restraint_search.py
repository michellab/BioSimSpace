        Parameters
        ----------

        system : :class:`System <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.System>`
            The molecular system for the ABFE simulation. This must contain
            a single decoupled molecule and is assumed to have already
            been equilibrated.

        protocol : :class:`Protocol.Production <BioSimSpace.Protocol.Production>`, \
            The simulation production protocol.

        work_dir : str
            The working directory for the ABFE restraint generation
            simulation.

        engine : str
            The molecular dynamics engine used to run the simulation. Available
            options are "AMBER", "GROMACS", or "SOMD". If this argument is omitted
            then BioSimSpace will choose an appropriate engine for you.

        gpu_support : bool
            Whether the engine must have GPU support.

        ignore_warnings : bool
            Whether to ignore warnings when generating the binary run file.
            This option is specific to GROMACS and will be ignored when a
            different molecular dynamics engine is chosen.

        show_errors : bool
            Whether to show warning/error messages when generating the binary
            run file. This option is specific to GROMACS and will be ignored
            when a different molecular dynamics engine is chosen.

        extra_options : dict
            A dictionary containing extra options. Overrides the ones generated from the protocol.

        extra_lines : list
            A list of extra lines to be put at the end of the script.

        property_map : dict
            A dictionary that maps system "properties" to their user defined
            values. This allows the user to refer to properties with their
            own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }

         ----------

         restraint_type: str
             The type of restraints to select (currently only Boresch is available).
             Default is 'Boresch'.

         method: str
             The method to use to derive the restraints. 'BSS' or 'MDRestraintsGenerator'.
             BSS uses the native BioSimSpace derivation.

         append_to_ligand_selection: str
             Appends the supplied string to the default atom selection which chooses
             the atoms in the ligand to consider as potential anchor points. The default
             atom selection is f'resname {ligand_resname} and not name H*'. Uses the
             mdanalysis atom selection language. For example, 'not name O*' will result
             in an atom selection of f'resname {ligand_resname} and not name H* and not
             name O*'.

         receptor_selection_str: str
             The selection string for the atoms in the receptor to consider
             as potential anchor points. The default atom selection is
             'protein and name CA C N'. Uses the mdanalysis atom selection
             language.

         force_constant: BioSimSpace.Types.Energy / BioSimSpace.Types.Area
             The force constant to use for all restraints. For angles, the units of
             area will be converted to A-2 and exchanged for rad-2. If None,
             the default force constants are used, which are 10 kcal mol-1 A-2 [rad-2] when
             method == "MDRestraintsGenerator", or fit to fluctuations observed during
             the simulation is method == "BSS".

        cutoff: BioSimSpace.Types.Length
            The greatest distance between ligand and receptor anchor atoms.
            Only affects behaviour when method == "BSS" Receptor anchors
            further than cutoff Angstroms from the closest ligand anchors will not
            be included in the search for potential anchor points.

         restraint_idx: int
             The index of the restraint from a list of candidate restraints ordered by
             suitability. restraint_idx != 0 is only valid if method == 'BSS'.

         block : bool
             Whether to block until the process has finished running.

               'protein and name CA C N'. Uses the mdanalysis atom selection
               language.

           force_constant: BioSimSpace.Types.Energy / BioSimSpace.Types.Area
               The force constant to use for all restraints. For angles, the units of
               area will be converted to A-2 and exchanged for rad-2. If None,
               the default force constants are used, which are 10 kcal mol-1 A-2 [rad-2] when
               method == "MDRestraintsGenerator", or fit to fluctuations observed during
               the simulation is method == "BSS".

           cutoff: BioSimSpace.Types.Length,
               The greatest distance between ligand and receptor anchor atoms.
               Only affects behaviour when method == "BSS" Receptor anchors
               further than cutoff Angstroms from the closest ligand anchors will not
               be included in the search for potential anchor points.

            restraint_idx: int
                The index of the restraint from a list of candidate restraints ordered by
                suitability. restraint_idx != 0 is only valid if method == 'BSS'.

        MDRestraintsGenerator. Please see:

        https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4570556
        https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-007

        Some of the main differences compared to MDRestraintsGenerator are:

            - Scoring by configurational volume, rather than total variance
            - Setting the force constants based on variances, rather than uniformly
            - Checking the restraints for instabilities based on the energy penalty
              for approaching points of instability, rather than absolute values of
              e.g. angles.

        Parameters
        ----------

        u : MDAnalysis.Universe
            The trajectory for the ABFE restraint calculation as a
            MDAnalysis.Universe object.

        system : :class:`System <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.System>`
            The molecular system for the ABFE restraint calculation. This
            must contain a single decoupled molecule and is assumed to have
            already been equilibrated.

        temperature : :class:`System <BioSimSpace.Types.Temperature>`
            The temperature of the system

        ligand_selection_str: str
            The selection string for the atoms in the ligand to consider
            as potential anchor points.

        receptor_selection_str: str
            The selection string for the protein in the ligand to consider
            as potential anchor points.

        work_dir : str
            The working directory for the simulation.

        force_constant: BioSimSpace.Types.Energy / BioSimSpace.Types.Area
            The force constant to use for all restraints. For angles, the units of
            area will be converted to A-2 and exchanged for rad-2. If None,
            the default force constants are used, which are 10 kcal mol-1 A-2 [rad-2] when
            method == "MDRestraintsGenerator", or fit to fluctuations observed during
            the simulation is method == "BSS".

        cutoff: BioSimSpace.Types.Length
            The greatest distance between ligand and receptor anchor atoms.
            Only affects behaviour when method == "BSS" Receptor anchors
            further than cutoff Angstroms from the closest ligand anchors will not
            be included in the search for potential anchor points.

        restraint_idx: int
            The index of the restraint from a list of candidate restraints ordered by
            increasing configurational volume - a lower index gives a stronger restraint.

        Returns
        -------

        restraint : :class:`Restraint <BioSimSpace.Sandpit.Exscientia.FreeEnergy.Restraint>`
            The restraints of `restraint_type` which best mimic the strongest receptor-ligand
            interactions.
