    Generate a perturbation network using Lead Optimisation Mappper (LOMAP).

    Parameters
    ----------

    molecules : :[class:`Molecule <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.Molecule>`], \
                 [rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol]
        A list of molecules. (Both BioSimSpace and RDKit molecule objects
        are supported.)

    names : [str]
        A list of names for the molecules. If None, then the index of each
        molecule will be used.

    work_dir : str
        The working directory for the LOMAP process.

    plot_network : bool
        Whether to plot the network when running from within a notebook.
        If using a 'work_dir', then a PNG image will be located in
        'work_dir/images/network.png'.

    links_file : str
        Path to a file providing links to seed the LOMAP graph with. Each
        record in the file must contain a minimum of two entries, i.e. the
        names of the ligands of interest, e.g.
            ligA ligB
        The third column can include a pre-computed score for the ligand
        pair, e.g.
            ligA ligB score
        A value of < -1 means 'recompute', but force the link to be included.
        A negative value (>= -1) means use the absolute value as the score,
        but force the link to be included. A positive means use this value
        as the score, but treat the link as normal in the LOMAP graph
        calculation. Finally, if the fourth column contains the string
        'force', then the link is included, irrespective of its score.

    property_map : dict
        A dictionary that maps "properties" in molecule0 to their user
        defined values. This allows the user to refer to properties
        with their own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }

    n_edges_forced : int
        An integer that forces the number of edges that should be used in
        the perturbation network. Must be in the range
        [1 .. (len(molecules)**2-len(molecules))/2].
        In cases where n_edges_forced > the number of edges suggested by
        LOMAP, BioSimSpace will add the top scoring n edges parsed from the
        LOMAP output file and add them to the network. Conversely if
        n_edges_forced < the number of edges suggested by LOMAP, BioSimSpace
        will remove the bottom n edges parsed from the LOMAP output file.
        This last option is discouraged as it can cause network cycle
        breakage and disconnecting of ligands/clusters from the network.

    **kwargs : dict
        A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass through to LOMAP. These
        will take precedence over any default values that are set.

    Returns
    -------

    edges : [(int, int)]
        A tuple containing the edges of the network. Each edge is itself
        a tuple, containing the indices of the molecules that are
        connected by the edge.

    scores : [float]
        The LOMAP score for each edge. The higher the score implies that a
        perturbation between molecules along an edge is likely to be more
        accurate.

    """
    Find mappings between atom indices in molecule0 to those in molecule1.
    Molecules are aligned using a Maximum Common Substructure (MCS) search.
    When requesting more than one match, the mappings will be sorted using
    a scoring function and returned in order of best to worst score. (Note
    that, depending on the scoring function the "best" score may have the
    lowest value.).

    Parameters
    ----------

    molecule0 : :class:`Molecule <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.Molecule>`
        The molecule of interest.

    molecule1 : :class:`Molecule <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.Molecule>`
        The reference molecule.

    scoring_function : str
        The scoring function used to match atoms. Available options are:
          - "rmsd"
              Calculate the root mean squared distance between the
              coordinates of atoms in molecule0 to those that they
              map to in molecule1.
          - "rmsd_align"
              Align molecule0 to molecule1 based on the mapping before
              computing the above RMSD score.
          - "rmsd_flex_align"
              Flexibly align molecule0 to molecule1 based on the mapping
              before computing the above RMSD score. (based on the
              'fkcombu'. package: https://pdbj.org/kcombu)

    matches : int
        The maximum number of matches to return. (Sorted in order of score).

    return_scores : bool
        Whether to return a list containing the scores for each mapping.

    prematch : dict
        A dictionary of atom mappings that must be included in the match.

    timeout : BioSimSpace.Types.Time
        The timeout for the maximum common substructure search.

    complete_rings_only : bool
        Whether to only match complete rings during the MCS search. This
        option is only relevant to MCS performed using RDKit and will be
        ignored when falling back on Sire.

    max_scoring_matches : int
        The maximum number of matching MCS substructures to consider when
        computing mapping scores. Consider reducing this if you find the
        matchAtoms function to be taking an excessive amount of time. This
        option is only relevant to MCS performed using RDKit and will be
        ignored when falling back on Sire.

    property_map0 : dict
        A dictionary that maps "properties" in molecule0 to their user
        defined values. This allows the user to refer to properties
        with their own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }

    property_map1 : dict
        A dictionary that maps "properties" in molecule1 to their user
        defined values.

    Returns
    -------

    matches : dict, [dict], ([dict], list)
        The best atom mapping, a list containing a user specified number of
        the best mappings ranked by their score, or a tuple containing the
        list of best mappings and a list of the corresponding scores.

    Examples
    --------

    Find the best maximum common substructure mapping between two molecules.

    >>> import BioSimSpace as BSS
    >>> mapping = BSS.Align.matchAtoms(molecule0, molecule1)

    Find the 5 best mappings.

    >>> import BioSimSpace as BSS
    >>> mappings = BSS.Align.matchAtoms(molecule0, molecule1, matches=5)

    Find the 5 best mappings along with their ranking scores.

    >>> import BioSimSpace as BSS
    >>> mappings, scores = BSS.Align.matchAtoms(molecule0, molecule1, matches=5, return_scores=True)

    Find the 5 best mappings along with their ranking scores. Score
    by flexibly aligning molecule0 to molecule1 based on each mapping
    and computing the root mean squared displacement of the matched
    atoms.

    >>> import BioSimSpace as BSS
    >>> mappings, scores = BSS.Align.matchAtoms(molecule0, molecule1, matches=5, return_scores=True, scoring_function="rmsd_flex_align")

    Find the best mapping that contains a prematch (this is a dictionary mapping
    atom indices in molecule0 to those in molecule1).

    >>> import BioSimSpace as BSS
    >>> mapping = BSS.Align.matchAtoms(molecule0, molecule1, prematch={0 : 10, 3 : 7})

        The maximum number of matching MCS substructures to consider when
        computing mapping scores. Consider reducing this if you find the
        matchAtoms function to be taking an excessive amount of time.

    property_map0 : dict
        A dictionary that maps "properties" in molecule0 to their user
