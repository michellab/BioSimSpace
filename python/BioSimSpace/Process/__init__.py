Examples
========

Print the list of supported molecular dynamics packages.

.. code-block:: python

   import BioSimSpace as BSS

   print(BSS.Process.packages())

Create a process to apply a minimisation protocol to a molecular system
using the `AMBER <http://ambermd.org>`_ package. Execute the process and
get the minimised molecular system.

.. code-block:: python

   import BioSimSpace as BSS

   # Load a molecular system from file.
   system = BSS.IO.readMolecules(BSS.IO.glob("amber/ala/*"))

   # Create a minimisation protocol with 1000 steps.
   protocol = BSS.Protocol.Minimisation(steps=1000)

   # Create a process object to run the simulation with AMBER.
   process = BSS.Process.Amber(system, protocol)

   # Start the process in the background.
   process.start()

   # Wait for the process to finish.
   process.wait()

   # Get the minimised molecular system.
   minimised = process.getSystem()
