class ProcessRunner:
    """
    A class for managing and running multiple simulation processes, e.g.
    a free energy simulation at multiple lambda values.

    Since BioSimSpace handles its own background processes it is unsuitable
    for use with Python modules such as concurrent.futures, where use of
    objects like a ProcessPoolExecutor would lead to redundant processes,
    i.e. a process would be created, from which BioSimSpace would fork its
    own background process. Instead, we recommend using a ProcessRunner,
    which can handle the running of processes for you, both in serial and
    parallel.

    At present there is no way to allocate specific compute resources to
    individual processes. As such, unless you have access to a large amount
    of compute, when executing the runner in parallel we recommend that the
    individual processes are serial in nature. BioSimSpace is not intended
    to be a workflow manager and the ProcessRunner is only meant to help
    facilitate running of more complex, multi-leg simulation processes. If
    you desire more fine-grained resource control we recommend breaking your
    workflow into separate :class:`nodes <BioSimSpace.Gateway.Node>`, which
    can be run independently and allocated their own specific resources.
